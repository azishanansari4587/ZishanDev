        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 dark:text-white">1. What is User Authentication?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">User authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user attempting to access a system or application. It ensures that users are who they claim to be, typically through the use of credentials such as usernames and passwords. The goal of authentication is to prevent unauthorized access and confirm the legitimacy of users.</p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 dark:text-white">How Authentication Works:</h3>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>User Input:</strong> When a user attempts to log in, they provide their credentials (username and password).</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Credential Verification:</strong> The application checks the provided credentials against the stored records in the database.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Access Granted or Denied:</strong> If the credentials match, the user is authenticated and granted access to the application; if not, access is denied.</li>
        </ol>    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 dark:text-white">Common Authentication Methods:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Username and Password:</strong> The most common form of authentication, where users enter a combination of a username and password.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> An additional layer of security that requires users to provide two or more verification factors (e.g., a password and a text message code).</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> Uses physical characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to verify identity.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>OAuth/OpenID Connect:</strong> Allows users to authenticate using third-party services (e.g., Google, Facebook) without creating a new account.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 dark:text-white">2. What is User Authorization?</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">User authorization is the process of determining whether an authenticated user has permission to access specific resources or perform certain actions within an application. It establishes the rules and permissions that dictate what users can and cannot do after they have been authenticated.</p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 dark:text-white">How Authorization Works:</h3>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Access Control Checks:</strong> Once a user is authenticated, the application checks their permissions against predefined rules.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Resource Access:</strong> Based on the user's roles or attributes, the application grants or denies access to specific resources or actions (e.g., viewing data, editing records).</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>User Experience:</strong> Users will only see and interact with the features and data they have permission to access.</li>
        </ol>    
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 dark:text-white">Common Authorization Methods:</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Users are assigned roles, and permissions are granted based on those roles (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):</strong> Access is granted based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment, providing more granular control.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Policies and Rules:</strong> Define specific rules for different user roles or actions, allowing for flexible and customizable access control.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 dark:text-white">3. Key Differences Between Authentication and Authorization</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">While authentication and authorization are closely related, they serve different purposes in the security framework of an application. Here’s a clear breakdown of their differences:</p>

        </ul>
        
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 dark:text-white"">Authorization</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400">
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Define Clear Roles and Permissions:</strong> Establish well-defined roles and associated permissions to control access effectively.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong>Implement Least Privilege Principle:</strong> Grant users the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.</li>
            <li class="mb-2"><strong> Regularly Review and Update Permissions:</strong> Periodically audit user permissions to ensure they align with current roles and responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-6 dark:text-white">5. Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed dark:text-gray-400 m-4">User authentication and authorization are critical components of application security. While authentication verifies the identity of users, authorization determines their access rights and permissions within the system. By understanding the differences between these two concepts and implementing best practices, developers can create secure applications that protect sensitive user data and maintain a safe user experience.</p>
